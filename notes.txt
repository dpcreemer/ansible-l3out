From new linux VM...
- Installing pip for python3
	- sudo apt install python3-pip
- Installing Ansible
	- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
	- sudo pip3 install ansible
	- verify with: ansible --version
- Add modules
	- ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.aci
- Create file structure
	- project root ~/Development/ansible/lab-l3out
	- https://aci-prog-lab.ciscolive.com/lab/pod1/bonus/ansible-aci
	- mkdir group_vars
	- mkdir roles
	- hosts file
			# hosts file for Ansible Playbook
			[apic]
			bloom-aci.rtp.lab
	- site.yaml file
			--- 
			# main playbook
			- hosts: apic
			  roles:
			  - role: tenant
			  - role: l3out
	- group_vars/all file
			---
			ansible_connection: local
			user: labowski
			password: TheDudeAbides!
	- create roles
		- cd roles
		- ansible-galaxy init tenant
		- ansible-galaxy init l3out
- Validate environment is ready
	- ansible-playbook -vi hosts site.yaml
- Setup tenant role
	- edit vars/main.yaml
	- edit tasks/main.yaml
- validate
	- ansible-playbook -vi hosts site.yaml
- Problem 1:  Have to repeat hostname, username, password, and validate_certs in every task
	- https://blog.wimwauters.com/devops/2020-01-16-aci_ansible/
	- use the merge operator <<
- Setup l3out role
	- edit vars/main.yaml and tasks/main.yaml
	- Create root l3out object with  aci_l3out module 
		- Problem 2:  "Invalid Configuration Unenforced Route Control is not supported for Export direction."
			- fix 1:  Set "route_control" to "export" in task
			- fix 2:  Fix the module so that "export" is the default
				- edit module: ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/cisco/aci/plugins/modules/aci_l3out.py
				- change line 293
					- from:    enforce_ctrl = ''
					- to:          enforce_ctrl = 'export'
	- Create Logical Node Profile with aci_l3out_logical_node_profile
	- Add nodes to node profile with aci_l3out_logical_node
		- Problem 3: Repetition
			- fix: use loops. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_gucd ide/playbooks_loops.html
		- Problem 4: Scale
			- fix: make "nodes" list in var file with.  Each node is a dictionary of Node ID and Router ID.
	- Add interface profile with aci_l3out_logical_interface_profile
	- Add interfaces with aci_l3out_interface
		- Problem: Repetition inside list
	- Add BGP peer info with aci_l3out_bgp_peer
		- Problem: Module has no way to define local AS
		- Fix:  Modify Module: 
	- Add External EPG/Network
	- Do Contract stuff
		- Add Contract/Subject/Filter
		- Add Contract to extEPG and VRF

Ok, now we have a working solution, so how can we make it better?
- Don't use stored credentials (prompt)   -  (Ok, I know we could use Vault or some fancy shit.  Maybe later...)
	- (New project)
	- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_prompts.html
	- Add vars_prompt to site.yaml
	- Remove stored credentials from group_vars/all
- I provide the leaf sub-interface address, the peer address should be obvious.  Can I calculate that instead of putting it in as a variable?
	- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters_ipaddr.html
	- install netaddr module:
		- pip3 install netaddr
	- Change VAR file to use "net" for ip peering info and change tasks to calculate leaf address and peer address.

What about NetBox?  I need to find available network/vlan/and ASN info...
- Fetch data from Netbox
	- Install netbox.netbox collection
		- ansible-galaxy collection install netbox.netbox
		- pip3 install pynetbox
	- Prefix  
		- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/netbox/netbox/index.html#plugins-in-netbox-netbox
